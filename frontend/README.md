# Jeeves Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)

A minimal React frontend scaffolded with Vite and TypeScript. The app renders a blank white main page component called `MainScreen`.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server
- `npm run build` — type-check and build for production
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

By default, the root component `App` renders `MainScreen`, which is a full-viewport blank white screen ready for you to add UI.
